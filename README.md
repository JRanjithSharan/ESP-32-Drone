# ESP-32 Drone

This repository contains the code and documentation for controlling a drone using an ESP-32 microcontroller. The project allows remote control of the drone via a web interface.

## Features

- **Web-based Control:** Operate the drone from any device with a web browser.
- **ESP-32 Integration:** Utilize the ESP-32 microcontroller for real-time control and communication.
- **Customizable:** Easily modify and extend the functionality to suit specific needs.

## Components

- **ESP-32 Microcontroller**
- **Drone (compatible with ESP-32)**
- **Web Interface for control**
- **Additional components as per drone requirements**

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JRanjithSharan/ESP-32-Drone.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have the ESP-IDF or Arduino IDE set up for ESP-32 development. Install the necessary libraries and dependencies as specified in the code.

3. **Upload Code to ESP-32:**

   Connect the ESP-32 to your computer and upload the code using your preferred development environment (ESP-IDF or Arduino IDE).

4. **Configure Network Settings:**

   Update the network settings in the code to match your Wi-Fi configuration. This ensures the ESP-32 can connect to your local network and communicate with the web interface.

## Usage

1. **Access the Web Interface:**

   Once the ESP-32 is connected to the network, access the web interface by navigating to the ESP-32’s IP address in your web browser.

2. **Control the Drone:**

   Use the web interface to send commands and control the drone’s movements. The interface allows for various operations, including takeoff, landing, and directional control.

## Code Structure

- **`main.cpp`**: Contains the main control logic for the ESP-32 and drone communication.
- **`web_server.cpp`**: Manages the web server and handles incoming commands from the web interface.
- **`config.h`**: Configuration file for network settings and other parameters.

## Troubleshooting

- **ESP-32 Not Connecting to Wi-Fi:** Ensure the network settings in `config.h` are correct and that the ESP-32 is within range of your Wi-Fi network.
- **Web Interface Not Loading:** Check that the ESP-32 is properly connected to the network and that the IP address is correct.
